        <h1>Dear Dorra,</h1>
        <p>
            As I sit down to write this, my heart is overflowing with love and gratitude for you. From the moment you entered my life, everything has changed for the better. Your smile, your kindness, and how lucky I am to have you by my side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day with you feels like a beautiful dream. Your laughter is my favorite sound, and your presence brings me an indescribable sense of peace and joy. You are my best friend, my confidant, and the love of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am constantly amazed by your strength, your wisdom, and your compassion. You make the world a brighter place, not just for me, but for everyone who knows you. I am so proud of all that you are and all that you do.
        </p>
        <p>
            As your birthday approaches, I want to be the first to wish you a very happy early birthday. I hope this year brings you as much happiness and love as you have brought into my life. You deserve all the wonderful things that the world has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you more than words can express, and I look forward to celebrating many more birthdays, milestones, and moments together.
        </p>
